TODO:
    1. Client logout button closes socket. DONE
    2. Fix mouse track when player is near world edge
        Convert mx, my to real coords and compare to player.x and .y
        instead of statically comparing to canvas
        since player may not always be centered.
        DONE
    3. Fix actor generating inside one another. DONE

    4. Fix world scrolling after switching state back to play.
        Store stage params in Page? or some global and pass that in
        to each View construction.
        DONE

    5. Mobile! Fix margin-right to 100%
    Adjust view to fit screen
    add movement, interaction, reload, switch
    
    Movement idea: swipe to move, or
    check if touch is lower left
    then compute offset and theta from a fix lower left point to touch
    send the result velocity to server

    Other action ideas:
    add fixed bottoms rendered on screen like mobile screens
    shake
